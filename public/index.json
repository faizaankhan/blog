Testing any action callbacks becomes a mystic task sometimes, and I have seen a lot of people including me ending up writing a controller test calling the action of some other controller which inherits from the above controllers, and testing if the callback works, now this does solve the purpose if it’s just about writing a test somehow, but the strategy hides down the test for the callback into some random place, and it becomes almost useless. Let’s see how we can unit test our action callback methods, or even a helper method you have in your controllers taking example for the above two scenarios.

Here I have a small piece of code where I can send a 401 to the caller when there’s a failure in JWT authentication. class ApplicationController \u003c ActionController::API rescue_from JWT::VerificationError, with: :unauthorized_request private def unauthorized_request render status: :unauthorized end end Now testing the unauthorized_request method here is my goal, but how?. I can write a test for something like a SessionsController’s login method, send a data which can raise the verification error, and test if I get a 401 response. But would that be enough?, or good practice? I can test the behavior directly without calling some real action. Anonymous Controller is like dummy controllers that inherit from the described class, and allows us to add any dummy action to them. Rspec provides us with a method called controller in which we can pass a block with the actions we require. We are free to define any of the seven standard crud actions. # spec/controllers/application_controller_spec.rb RSpec.describe ApplicationController, type: :controller do controller do # Defining a dummy action for an anynomous controller which inherits from the described class. def index puts controller_name raise JWT::VerificationError end end describe \"handling jwt validation errors\" do it \"should return status unauthorized\" do get :index expect(response).to have_http_status(:unauthorized) end end end In the above test, I have defined an index method that raises the error I need to test the application controller for if it’s handled or not. I have left a puts controller_name there, to show you that you will get anonymous as the controller name. So this looks simple, you can go ahead and test your dry codes. All the before action, after action and error handling will also be easy to test.

All these things make writing the test here a bit mind-boggling until you know how the anonymous thing works. What's Current.user in the above code? Current is a model inheriting from ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes, it lets you store thread isolated attributes. We generally use a Thread or this abstraction to store the current user, such that it’s available across model callbacks etc. If interested, you can see the API docs here Issue 1 - Namespaced controller: The RSpec method will find it hard to understand the described class and create the anonymous controller inheriting it since it’s a namespaced controller. What you need to do here, is that you need to define that and send it to the RSpec’s controller method as a parameter. As you can see, I have defined a DummyController in the spec below, which inherits from our ApiController. This will let us have the anonymous controller of our need as well as define the route in spec. Issue 2 - Custom action: For handling this, we will draw our own route to the custom_action, in the before the block in RSpec, yes, it’s as simple as that. # spec/controllers/api/version6/application_controller_spec.rb module Api module Version6 class DummyController \u003c Api::Version6::ApiController; end end end describe Api::Version6::ApiController, type: :controller do controller Api::Version6::DummyController do def custom_action render nothing: true end end before(:each) do routes.draw do namespace :api do namespace :version6 do get 'custom_action' =\u003e 'dummy#custom_action' end end end end context \"dummy controller\" do it \"should inherit from the api controller\" do expect(controller).to be_a_kind_of(Api::Version6::ApiController) end end context \"#store_current_user_in_thread\" do let!(:user) { create(:user) } it \"should set Current.user to nil when no user id in params\" do get :custom_action expect(Current.user).to eq(nil) end it \"should assign current user to current attributes thread when user id in params\" do get :custom_action, params: { user_id: user.id } expect(Current.user).to eq(user) end end end So, now you know you can define any dummy action in the RSpec, have an anonymous controller inheriting you dry controller codes, and can define any kind of route on the go, and test them.

Lucene is a powerful, built-for-purpose full-text search library. A full-text search is a technique for search engines where they allow us to search textual content in a document. Lucene takes a raw stream of characters, bundles them into tokens, and persists them as terms in an index(assume index as a table of contents, we will come to it very soon). It can quickly query that index and provide the ordered results. By using Lucene directly in our applications, or as part of a server, we can perform full-text searches in real-time over gigabytes of content. We also get custom analysis and scoring techniques, using which we can improve the relevance of results. Tokens: Data parsing in Lucene extracts out individual units like words from a raw stream of characters and stores them in indexes, these individual units are called tokens. They are occurrences of these words/units. Terms: Stored tokens are called terms, and they are unit of search, it consists of the text as a string and the field in the document where it was found. You can think of this all by thinking of yourself as Lucene, and assume you receive a lot of data from your input senses, one of your senses is the vision, and you are having a constant stream of data received in your mind. While you are moving across your house, and focussing on what’s kept at what place, you are processing these data streams, and creating an index of where the phone is, where the spoons are, and where the comb is.

Below I am creating an index named example-index-with-mapping and I am defining some fields.

Text field: \"file_name\": { \"type\": \"text\" }, defines that the field file_name is of a text datatype, a text datatype will let you store all kinds and sizes of textual data, the size limits are huge and you can actually store megabytes of data in text fields, and they will be searchable too. Keyword field: \"name\": { \"type\": \"keyword\" }, defines a keyword field name, keyword fields are also string, but they are for small contents on which you would perform a sort, or a filter. Like when you want to filter all students with a Bachelor in Engineering education background. Examples of fields you may want to set as a Keyword can be emails, education, city, country, hostnames, tags etc. Nested field: \"resume\": { \"type\": \"nested\", \"properties\": { \"id\": { \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"file_name\": { \"type\": \"text\" } } },, defines a nested field resume, a nested field is one which defines another document inside it. Here resume is defined as a nested document, with id and file_name as it’s fields. A nested field is an array of documents inside the document. Object field \"education\": { \"properties\": { \"id\": { \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"name\": { \"type\": \"keyword\" } } }, defines education as an Object datatype, note that the way education is defined is so similar to the nested field, the only difference is that we haven’t mentioned type nested.

Sometimes when you try to scrape a website, you are barred from it because the safety protocol does not allow you to do so. There are many automated scrapper scripts continuously running to scrape a website.

These are all well documented on Amazon documentation as well as the library which might use to integrate with AWS, So why this post ? The reason for that is there’s a lot of options, and to help you with what you need in the beginning here I list my opinions and my suggested way of doing it. Remember working on a DynamoDB is almost a no-brainer when you got your basics clear. If you are a beginner and you know nothing about no SQL databases, I have a basic introduction post where I talk about most of the if’s and but’s you need to know and a simple guide on the concepts DynamoDB here. Here my choice of language is Ruby, but it’s an easy digest for any other as well. Note for rails users For rails users, DynamoDB is not the right choice for ORM in my opinion, but you might have a different one. If you are looking for using DynamoDB with your Active Record here’s the best you got with this gem called Dynamoid. If that’s not what you need Dynamo for this is the right place.

The flags are well described here java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -inMemory And Hurray, your local DB server is running.

Linux Users: sudo apt install awscli Mac Users: brew install awscli (Add Homebrew if you don’t have it 🙂 Alternatively, take some time and read about cli here Now that we have aws-cli and dynamoDB client running on the local machine. We can go ahead and run a command. Let’s see what all tables exists, we expect the output should be empty. But Before that we need to configure AWS credentials, don’t worry we only need fake values for the local system to work. Run aws configure Add any fake string as shown in the image below, for access key id and access key secret. Set an AWS region, some examples include, us-west-2, ap-south-1. Set CLI response type to JSON, or whatever your choice is if you read the CLI documentation. We have a local instance set, credentials added for aws-cli, and now we should be able to make a call to our local dynamoDB. aws dynamodb list-tables --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000 aws configure example (Click to Expand)\" aws configure example (Click to Expand) That’s all for local setup and using API endpoints through CLI. You can update your credentials to real one, and not pass an endpoint URL in a general case, to use the AWS dynamoDB which is on the cloud. If due to some config issue it doesn’t fetch data from the table you want, you might need to pass an end-point URL, and for that you can follow the standard scheme for AWS service URLs. Aws service URL structure is: protocol://service-code.region-code.amazonaws.com. So for a dynamoDB table in us-west-2, we will have the endpoint as https://dynamodb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com.

Rails users can add specific classes and codes as per their choices in initializers and concerns etc. We will use the gem aws-sdk-dynamodb, so create a Gemfile, and add the latest one from RubyGems, and bundle. At the time of writing this I’m using gem 'aws-sdk-dynamodb', '~\u003e 1.0.0.rc7' # In Gemfile source 'https://rubygems.org' gem 'aws-sdk-dynamodb', '~\u003e 1.0.0.rc7' Now we will create an AWS dynamoDB client object, such that it can be used to perform the actions. In the most basic syntax this is as simple as calling new on Aws::DynamoDB::Client class with a region option passed. And if you are in an environment with a preset AWS config, it is all you need. def client @client ||= Aws::DynamoDB::Client.new(region: \"us-west-2\") end Ok, we can define the aws global configs for this app if required as below, assuming credentials struct is from the environment. And that should be good to go for using client. Aws.config.update( access_key_id: credentials.aws[:access_key_id], secret_access_key: credentials.aws[:secret_access_key], region: credentials.aws[:region] ) We can also pass, the config key-value pairs to the Aws::DynamoDB::Client class while initializing it, and that will also be good enough. Since through this post we will be using local dynamoDB, we only need to pass a region and our local endpoint URL. def client @client ||= Aws::DynamoDB::Client.new(region: 'us-west-2', endpoint: 'http://localhost:8000') end By now, we have added the required gem, and have a client object.

Also, many tend to use the web console to create the tables and use them since it’s a one-time affair, but it is important for them who are adding it to an application and want to use for different environments etc. We will use create_table API endpoint. Here we need to understand a few basic options which we will be sending in params. table_name: Table name 🙂 key_schema: Key schema is an array of objects containing information about fields which you want as your primary key. attribute_name: It’s the field name for which you are setting a primary key attribute key_type: It defines the role of the key attribute set, Hash defines a partition key and range defines a sort key. attribute_definitions: Here we need to define the data type of the attributes we are setting in key schemas for the table and any indexes which other than our primary index too. The data types for the attributes are: S - the attribute is of type String N - the attribute is of type Number B - the attribute is of type Binary provisioned_throughput: provisioned throughput is about what kind of capacity you wish to have and will pay for. We don’t need to jump into understanding the exact need we have, AWS is tricky here and it’s a whole bunch of a subject. If you need to understand how the billing works for the provisioned system you can start with this.

Batch APIs BatchGetItem: It can be used to fetch items from different tables using Partition Key and Sort Key. In a single BatchGetItem call, we can fetch up to 16MB data or 100 items. BatchWriteItem: It can be used to delete or put items on one or more tables in DynamoDB in one call. We can write up to 16 MB data, which can be 25 put and delete requests. Query and Pagination APIs Query: Query operation will return all items that are matched with the partition key of the table. Sort Key is further useful to filter and sort items but it is optional. Scan: Scan operation doesn’t require Partition Key or Sort Key to fetch results from the table. As the name suggests, it scans an entire table to filter results based on attribute values passed as filters. Pagination: DynamoDB Query/Scan results return a maximum of 1MB response size so if our request matches an item of size more than 1MB, it gets automatically divided into pages. In such cases DynamoDB returns a special response parameter “LastEvaluatedKey” and this can be used to fetch next page results.

Dynamo provides us with two types of secondary indexes. Global secondary index – An index with a partition key and sort key that can be different from those on the table. They are stored detached from the main table with their own partition. Local secondary index – An index that has the same partition key as the table, but a different sort key.

Availability — Every non-failing node returns a response for all read and write requests in a reasonable amount of time. Partition Tolerant — The system continues to function and upholds its consistency guarantees in spite of network partitions. Here’s an image which is a nice depiction of the above 3 properties. You can see that, DynamoDB provides us with Availability and Partition Tolerance, but doesn’t guarantee Consistency. Although as of 2020 AWS has a strongly consistent and transactional consistent model, where AWS promises data consistency, it’s not the best player in that area.

Here’s a list of questions, I copied from AWS documentation 😉 These are just enough to decide if all the “Gyaan” above didn’t work. Can you organize your data in hierarchies or an aggregate structure in one or two tables? Are traditional backups impractical because of table update rate or overall data size? Does your database workload vary significantly by time or have high-traffic events? Does your application or service consistently require response time in the single milliseconds? Do you need to provide services in a scalable, replicated configuration? Does your application need to store data in the high-terabyte size range? Are you willing to invest in a short but possibly steep NoSQL learning curve? Is data protection important? Those questions are really the marketing ones. But hey, AWS promises you something. I will add another one: Are you on AWS cloud services already? You can obviously use it from other services like a GCP, but that won’t be secure on the go.

Data stored in the DynamoDB is redundantly copied across multiple Availability Zones and thus it protects data loss due to underlying hardware failures by default, which is a big thing. In simple terms, you can say that DynamoDB can handle a large amount of data and large traffic without you worrying about the architecture behind, and can be integrated to your application like butter with the AWS ecosystem.

Each table contains several items in each row, and each item has keys and values for each column.

So in the above example, you can keeping adding different kinds of scores or any other information. You just define the primary key and data can be added with a dynamic set of keys and values.

The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table, so that no two items can have the same key. A dynamo primary key is either based on a single field or a couple of fields. Partition key – A simple primary key, composed of one attribute known as the partition key. DynamoDB uses the partition key’s value as input to an internal hash function. The output from the hash function determines the partition (physical storage internal to DynamoDB) in which the item will be stored. Partition key and sort key - Referred to as a composite primary key, and as the name suggests it is composed of two attributes. The first attribute is the partition key, and the second attribute is the sort key. All items with the same partition key value are stored together, in sorted order by sort key value. Let’s add a sort key on the previous example: UUID (Partition Key) StudentName (Sort Key) MathsScore BioScore AccountsScore 1212-3322-5861-9865 Ram 59 98 1582-2249-9513-6538 Shyam 79 89 When you have a composite primary key, the uniqueness is checked on the pair of partition and sort keys, so in the above example we have UUID, but uniqueness is only checked on UUID and StudentName together as a unit, so one can also store another record with the same UUID and a different StudentName. The selection of a wise primary key is very important as the DB is indexed on your primary key and provides with a quick result when you try to find by an indexed field. And this selection is one of the places where your most of the thinking should go when you are modeling your data.

In my pursuit of learning and trying out things, with my baby turtle steps, I have realized one thing, that feeling confident about something and being confident enough to explain other people are two very different things. Just like living a moment and being able to share other people how you felt about it. The later provides me with extreme joy and maybe as a human acceptance from people makes me happy about it. In general, I am no good with conversations, or writing, but it’s never too late right? So here’s me starting to share the experiences I have with creating something, configuring something, hating something, and living something. Wish me luck, and less procrastination.
